# Outlier Detection

[View Final Result](https://hencho108.github.io/outlier-detection/Outlier_Detection.html)

The objective of this project was to detect anomalies, i.e. patterns that do not conform to “normal” behavior, in a dataset of breast cancer biopsies. 

Three common outlier detection methods were compared: Mahalanobis Distance, DBSCAN and Expectation Maximization. 

The analysis highlighted the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm and provided insights about situations when one model would be preferable to another.
